This repository contains all code developed for the Robotics 4 Farmers project. The goal is to implement a SLAM algorithm tailored for vineyard environments using an RGB-D camera and GNSS compass. The system combines a YOLO neural network to identify vine trunks and posts with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). This project is optimized for deployment on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin platform.
